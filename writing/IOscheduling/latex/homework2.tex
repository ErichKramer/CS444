\subsection{IOScheduling}


Linux makes use of three different schedulers, as their applicability varies for 
different devices. It is important to be intelligent and to reorder requests so that those
which are in sequence are read in order. In doing this it is possible to optimize read speed
on average, at the cost of some requests being served out of order. 

During typical runtime the Kernel can easily switch between any of these IOschedulers
allowing adaptable behavior for meeting variable demand.

\subsubsection{No-Op Scheduler}

The No-Op Scheduler often works best on memory backed block devices which do not have a rotational
system, as optimizing order on these types of devies does not impact overall access time. This would
lead to arbitrary computation and favoritism between processes \cite{stackDisc}. 


\subsubsection{Deadline Scheduler}

The deadline scheduler pushes the Linux Kernel's behavior closer to that of a real time 
operating system. It sets a hard limit on the amount of time I/O might wait, servicing 
those which have exceeded a certain time limit before anything else \cite{stackDisc}. 

\subsubsection{CFQ Scheduler}

To quote the Linux Kernel documentation "The main aim of the CFQ scheduler is to 
provide a fair allocation of the disk I/O bandwidth for all the processes which requests[sic]
an I/O operation." \cite{CFQ}. A process's I/O prority is used to determine how I/O requests
are batched together. The Completely Fair Queuing scheduler places each processes requests 
into a per-process queue. These queues are then allocated timeslices for access to the disk,
where the time slice size is contingent on priority. 



\section{Windows}

\subsection{IOScheduling}

Windows I/O Scheduling operates via layers of complexity and abstraction much greater than
that of Linux or FreeBSD. In doing this Windows is able to create a uniform interface for 
developers while still having fine tuned optimization.

\subsubsection{IRPs}

Windows uses its own in-house I/O Request Packets (IRPs) for talking to drivers. Via a Subsystem 
layer of abstraction developers do not have to worry about driver specifics or configurations.
IRPs are spun up by the subsystem inside the Kernel mode, after their access rights have been 
verified. After a few steps the Kernel will return a handle for a file object to the subsystem, who
then returns it to a user-level application for access, or in the case of a failure an error is 
returned \cite{winIOView}.


\subsubsection{ File Objects }

Windows handles disk operations via file objects. To read a file from a mass-storage device you must
handle a file object returned by the subsystem. The subsystem calls the system services and requests 
to open a named file and then passes through the returned file object. A File object is a logical 
interface between kernel and user-mode processes and contains both the data in the file as well as
a few kernel attributes.
\cite{winFileOBJ} \cite{fOBJ}

%maybe remvoe this or rename it or make it less sassy I dunno smh
\subsubsection{Abstraction}
In doing this Windows can more easily hide information on how specifically their system works and 
can make it harder for projects like Wine to thrive. It also presents the benefit that programs
can be made portable between Windows versions. 




\section{FreeBSD}

Documentation for BSD is few and far between. The most insightful article is a paper published 
by Netflix \cite{IOBSDCAM}documenting advantages in their modifications to I/O scheduling in 
FreeBSD. Another helpful --yet outdated-- article from 2005 describes the IOScheduler for 
BSD as being based in 

\subsection{IOScheduling}

\subsubsection{Elevator}
Traditionally, BSD uses an elevator scheduler \cite{arrow}. As we have implemented in class,
the elevator, C-LOOK algorithm operates by scanning in one direction along the disk, stopping
to service requests which it travels over en-route to its destination. In doing this the average
time for each disk access is reduced, at the cost of fairness. 

\subsubsection{GEOM}

The GEOM based scheduler attempts to better optimize IO scheduling, more so than that of 
traditional elevator algorithms. 
\cite{GEOM} , \cite{arrow}

\subsubsection{BFQ}
Placing BFQ in FreeBSD is perhaps not full correct, as it also appears in Linux. However it is 
important to note the frequency of cross-polination between BSD and Linux. Both share code 
and solutions are carried between the two frequently. BFQ is one such example. My current
GNU/Linux distribution, Manjaro, comes out of the box with BFQ as its default. The
BFQ Scheduler (Budget-Fair Queueing) "operates similarly to CFQ, but supports hierarchical 
scheduling using a cgroups interface" \cite{BFQ}.
